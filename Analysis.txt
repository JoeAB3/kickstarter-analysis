# Kicker Campaign analysis prepared for Louise

## Overview of Project
Using historic Kickerstarer campaigns across several years and mediums to understand 
success vs failure

### General Purpose
To understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and heir funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges
I did an alanlysis of historic THEATER kickstar campaigns going back to 2009.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There truly appears to be a proper season for a successful theater Kickstar campaigns.  
About 32% of all campaigns are launched during the second quarter of the year.
Nearly 34% of successful campaigns are launched during the second quater.  
It's interesting to note that 65% of all the campaigns launched during the second quarter are successsful.
Please see the chart "Outcomes-vs_Goals" in the resources file.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
It does appear that there is a sweetspot in regards to the goals.
Campaigns seeking smaller donations appeared to be much more successful.  
The more money requested, the greater the chance that the campaign fails.
The chart is a little misleading due to that that it represents percentages.  
But, 76% of sucessful campaings were goals less than $5000, while only 55% failed (139 Index).
Please see the chart "Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch" in the resources file.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
This was a fairly satraightforward analysis, whitout many challenges.

## Results
The most important thing to takeaway from this anlaysis.  Those are the caimpaign timing and goal requested.
It appears the most successful campaign would be less than $%000, and launched in the Second Quarter.
The simplest answer is that the campaign sould be launched in May and be between $1000 and $4999.
There are some limitations based on this analysis.  We don't know they type of campaign launched.  
Or, the vaiiations within the goal buckets.
There are some other analyses that can be run.  Most importantly, instead of looking at percentages, the actual counts in the successful charts 
could/should be run.  Also, consider looking at comparing by year
